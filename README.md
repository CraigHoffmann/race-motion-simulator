# Motion Simulator for Online Motor Racing

This is just a personal record of my motion simulator build and configuration for future reference.

## SMC3
SMC3 is the arduino uno based motor driver I developed for the motion sim.

I released the code on xsimulator.net and it became one of the most popular drivers available due to it simplicity, flexibility and easy to source components.  Here is a link to the discussion thread... https://www.xsimulator.net/community/threads/smc3-arduino-3dof-motor-driver-and-windows-utilities.4957/

## SMC3 Windows Utilities
To aid in the easy configuration of the motor driver and sim setup, I also developed a windows graphical app.

Further details and discussion about the app can also be found on the xsimulator forum website link above.
